# YouTube Recommendation Bias — My Research

## Article  
[Ibrahim, H., Aldahoul, N., Lee, S., Rahwan, T., et al. _YouTube’s recommendation algorithm is left-leaning in the United States_. _PNAS Nexus_, 2(8), 2023. DOI:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad264](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/8/pgad264/7242446) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What I Found Interesting  
- This work uses bots (archetypal users) spanning a spectrum of political personas (from Far Left to Far Right) to test how YouTube’s recommendation system behaves. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- One of its key findings is that even users with **no watch history** still see a skew toward left‐leaning content in their baseline recommendations. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

## How I Used This in My Research  
In my project, I’m investigating the **effect of off-platform visits on Youtube's algorithm**, especially how recommendation systems might use your data collected by other sites.
