# YouTube Recommendation Bias — My Research

## Article  
[Ibrahim, H., Aldahoul, N., Lee, S., Rahwan, T., et al. _YouTube’s recommendation algorithm is left-leaning in the United States_. _PNAS Nexus_, 2(8), 2023. DOI:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad264](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/8/pgad264/7242446) 

## What I Found Interesting  
- This work uses bots (archetypal users) spanning a spectrum of political personas (from Far Left to Far Right) to test how YouTube’s recommendation system behaves.  
- One of its key findings is that even users with **no watch history** still see a skew toward left‐leaning content in their baseline recommendations. 

## How I Used This in My Research  
In my project, I’m investigating the **effect of off-platform visits on Youtube's algorithm**, especially how recommendation systems might use your data collected by other sites. 

## Andy's comment
This is interesting to see how "fake users" are being made to test the reaction of YouTube content. Maybe this use case can be applied in other areas such as how might fake customers of a certain archetype react to a landing page of a website or an app that you develop. I can see this being very useful.
